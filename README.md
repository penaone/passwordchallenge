# passwordchallenge

Password Generator Challenge requires building a website that will require
multiple levels of complexity in password security.

The  user can choose up to 4 different types of characters, Uppercase, lowercase, certain special characters and numbers
0-9.

The code requires for loops and if statements.

There are various functions that are required.
I used arrays vs a string value, for complexity and security.

The javascript code is then linked to <html> and css to provide the page structure and design elements.

The page is deployed at https://penaone.github.io/passwordchallenge/

Challenges faced include correctly formatting the functions.
The initial setup took time to decide.
How to set-up arrays and then build them into one array.

This was a great learning tool. Using the push command.git
